# Cuisinart Waffle Recipe
This is taken from the instruction manual from the new classic waffle maker. It's a start! I added an extra tbs of sugar for more browning!

## Ingredients
- 2c AP Flour
- 3T sugar
- 1T Baking Powder
- 1/2t salt

- 1 3/4c Milk
- 1/4+c oil (6T)
- 2 eggs
- 1/2c chocolate chips

## Directions
1. Mix Dry
2. Mix Wet
3. Mix together
4. waffle maker it

## Notes
- Feel free to omit chocolate chips
- Albin LOVED this recipe
- Jennene liked them more that she expected to
- Chloe liked them but 
	- liked her cookie waffles better
	- didn't like the choco chips
- I was surprised that the chocolate chips added crunch and they weren't overwhelming like usual

## Ideas
- Let's try this with oat milk instead of real milk and see where it lands
- I also want to try the [[Cuisinart  Corn Meal Waffles]] from the books
