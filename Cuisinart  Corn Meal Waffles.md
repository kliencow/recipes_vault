# Cuisinart Cornmeal Waffle Recipe
This is taken from the instruction manual from the new classic waffle maker. They recommend having these with soup and to treat them like cornbread rather than a breakfast waffle. I added the #side tag for that

## Ingredients
- 1 1/4c AP Flour
- 3/4c cornmeal
- 3T sugar
- 1T Baking Powder
- 1/2t salt

- 1 3/4c Milk
- 1/4+c oil (6T)
- 2 eggs
- 1/2c chocolate chips

## Directions
1. Mix Dry
2. Mix Wet
3. Mix together
4. waffle maker it

## Notes
- This is actually exactly the same recipe as [[Cuisinart Waffle Recipe]] but with some of the flour replaced with cornmeal. Wow, I'm kinda stoked it's so simple
