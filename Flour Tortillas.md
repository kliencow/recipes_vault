# Flour Tortillas
These are my honed and perfected flour tortillas. I spent an entire summer working on these. 

## Ingredients

| Amount            | Flour | Oil | Water | Salt |
| ----------------- | ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| 16 medium         | 494g  | 94g | 280g  | 10g  |
| 8 large / 12 med  | 370g  | 70g | 210g  | 7g   |
| 6 large,Â 12 small | 281g  | 53g | 150   | 5g   |
| 4 large, 8 small  | 187g  | 35g | 100g  | 3g   |

## Directions
1. add fat to flour, pinch mix until sandy and large clumps stick together softly
2. Mix hot water and salt. The water should be just almost too hot to touch
3. Pour water into flour, mix with spade hands then pinch with crab hands to shaggy
4. Kneed on counter for 8-10min until soft. Let rest for 1 min.
5. Shape into uniform something for cutting. Cut into portions.
6. Shape each portion into a ball, then flatten. Lay out on either flour or oil
7. Cover for 30min to keep moisture in
8. Heat cast iron flat pan / griddle to hot (5 on my stove), let come all the way up to heated
9. Roll each portion on light flour with rolling pin until very flat and wide
10. Cook until large bubbles appear, flied for a few seconds more
11. Keep made tortillas between two kitchen towels to trap moisture and heat.
12. Eat right away

## Notes
- Oil here can be interchangeably: lard, shortening, coconut oil
-  if you sub a liquid oil, the dough is *very* soft. Consider either using less or use more flour. I never had great luck with liquid oils, but they can make good tortillas with some extra attention.
- For coconut oil the unrefined gives the tortillas a subtle coconut smell and taste. I don't find it unpleasant. I added cinnamon one time to offset this and it worked pretty well. I'm not sure why I did that, it just felt right. The refined coconut oil does not leave a taste.
- Coconut oil can re solidify and become harder faster than lard or shortening. This will lead to a firmer dough. This doesn't seem to have a major end result, but left overs will seem crackerlike until reheated.
