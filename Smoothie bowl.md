# Smoothie bowl
I just made this up and it totally works! This is the base, but more fun can be added, like bananas or topped with granola!

## Ingredients
- 360g frozen mixed berries
- 400g oat milk
- 40g maple syrup

## Directions
1. blend

## Notes
- This is super thick and sets up right away in the blender. That's fine, just use the thick stuff. Pour it in a bowl, top with fun.

## Ideas
- Making half of this would be great for a smoothie bowl with toppings!
