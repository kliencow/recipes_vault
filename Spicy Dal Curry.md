# Spicy Dal Curry
This spicy Dal curry is made with delicious lentils, sweet potatos, red curry paste, and coconut milk. It's so damn GOOD!

Way better than I thought it would be! I'm super happy with the way this turned out.

## Ingredients
- 3 T olive oil
- 2 medium Sweet Potatoes, diced
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 3 T Thai red curry paste
- 3 garlic , minced
- 1 T grated garlic
- 1 t turmeric
- 1 c red lentils, rinsed
- 4 c chicken stock (veggie stock for v or V)
- 2 t kosher salt
- 1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
- 1 big couple handfuls of baby spinach
- Â½ lime of juice
 - Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving, more is more better
 
## Directions
1. Pan cook sweet potatoes in some oil until browned, set aside
2. sweat onions, then add spices aromatics
3. Add broth, lentils, and the sweet potatoes
4. simmer for 20min
5. add coconut milk, simmer 15min
6. add spinach, simmer 2min
7. add lime juice
8. serve with giant handfuls of cilantro as garnish

## Notes
- This shit is SPICY to start with, but it calms way down as the recipe goes on. By the next day, it was just barely spicy
- This is really good the next day!!
- There is an option to add a sliced serrano to the pot from the original recipe. That would be great except the fam would die.
- While it was still quite spicy at first, Jennene finished it and gave it a 7 out of 10! well, 3.5 out of 5. "Somewhere between a 4 and a 3" were her words. Sounds like a 8- to me! 
 
 ## Ideas
- toasted coconut flakes would be good. (the original recipe suggested that)
- roasting the potatoes might be fun too!
