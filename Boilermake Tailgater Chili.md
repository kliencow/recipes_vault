# Pork Tailgater Chili
I made this forever ago and  Jennene remembers this very fondly. I think I made a lot of adjustments to it and I think I need to again. The link in the metadata is for posterity, but I'm going to start changing the ingredients below. I might need to take the hot peppers out of here for the fam. So, you know, lots of things to change up in here. 

## Ingredients
- 2 lb ground beef 
- 1 lb Italian sausage
- 4 beans (chili, etc) (2 black, 1 pinto, 1 kidney)
- 2 large cans diced tomatoes
- 1 small can tomato paste
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 celery
- 2 green bell pepper
- 1 red bell pepper
- 2 cans green chilis
- 4 slices of cooked crumbled bacon
- 4 cubes beef bouillon
- 1 cup beer

Spices
- 1 T Worcestershire sauce
- Â¼ cup chili powder
- 2 t ground cumin
- 1 t garlic powder
- 2 T Mexican oregano
- 2 t cumin
- 1 t salt
- 1 t black pepper
- 1 t smoke paprika
- 1 t sugar

Topping ideas
- Fritos
- Shredded Cheese

## Directions
1. Chop: peppers, onion, celery. Drain beans.
2. Brown meat, pour off grease
3. Add everything but the cheese and Fritos, simmer for 2 hours
4. We can cook this for up to 6 hours. Adjust salt, chili, and spices every 2 hours
5. Put the Fritos into each bowl, ladle chili over the top

## Notes
- None yet!

## Ideas
- First round adjustments: remove hot spice, reduce the ground beef, increase salt (replace with soy sauce?), add anchovies. Add extra green bell pepper. Add smoke pap.
