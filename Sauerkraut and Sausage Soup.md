# Sour Kraut and Sausage Soup
This is a tasty soup that I found watching YouTube videos, in particular with Kenji. I want to try this out since I love cabbage soups.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb Kielbasa (or other smoked sausage)
- .25 lb bacon
- 2 c Sauerkraut
- 1 Yellow onion
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Potato
- Chicken stock
- 1 T Paprika
- 2 t cornstarch
- Bay leaves

## Directions
1. Cube carrots, slice onion, cube potato
2. Cut up bacon into bits, cut up sausage into chunks
3. Cook up bacon and sausage until a little browned
4. Add onions, sweat, add carrots
5. Add stock, then potatoes, bay leaves
6. Simmer 15min
7. Add slurry of spices

## Notes
- There are other fun spices to add here. I summarized the recipe as I remembered it from the video. I've made soups like this before, but I like how this came together quickly. 

## Ideas
- Try 1/2 cabbage 1/2 kraut
