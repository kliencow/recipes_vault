This is a placeholder for the recipe for what we all call Beans and Tortillas.

Just make [[Refried Beans]] and [[Flour Tortillas]]!

So easy and we all love it. We eat this nearly every Sunday.

Albin likes to take a ladle of beans onto his plate, add cheese, then pinch
Jennene likes making little bean and cheese burritos
Chloe likes making bean and cheese burritos with LOTS of cheese.
