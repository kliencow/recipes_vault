# Refried Beans
This is my master recipe for making refried beans. I've made these so many times that I've lost track. It's become the go to Sunday recipe. Not only can this feed and army pretty easily, excess beans work well for the rest of the week.

Still need to perfect this recipe. I think there is too much salt.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb beans (pinto or cranberry work best, pinks also work)
- 8c water
- 1 yellow onion
- 2T + 3T olive oil 
- 1T salt
- 1T chili powder
- 1t smoked pap
- 1T cumin
- 2t garlic powder
- 4 small or 2 large bay leaves
- 1-2T dried Mexican herb (oregano, thyme, etc.)

## Directions
### Cook the beans
1. sort beans, soak for 5min, then rinse
2. Cut onion into chucks, discarding skin
3. Add everything above to the pressure cooker
4. Pressure cook on high for 50-90min (depending on the bean)

### Refry the beans!
1. Discard bay leaves, strain the beans, reserve bean juice
2. Add 1 1/2T to 3T oils to a hot cast iron pan (depending on what % of beans you're refrying)
3. Add all or 1/2 the beans
4. fry untouched for about a minute then start smashing until all the beans are smashed and most of them are quite pulverized
5. Add juice to the desired consistency + a little too soupy
6. keep reducing and adding liquid until flavorful enough and texture is right
7. Hold by putting a thin layer of bean juice over the top and keep the burned warm
8. Mix in the juice, adjust consistency again, top with cheese if you want.

## Notes
- I've made this so many times and we always love it!
- I tried a little cinnamon once, and it really worked out nice. I didn't use much, maybe .5t or so.
- Lard really kicks the flavor up, but since I'm trying to eat healthier, I just use veg oil or olive oil (they're interchangeable and only affect the flavor here a tiny bit)
- I always forget to add oil to the pressure cooker, but that really is nice. Going double lard here tastes great! Double being in the pot and in the fry pan, not 2x the fat.
